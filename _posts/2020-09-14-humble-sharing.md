I've never been a writer, let alone a good one, not even in my native language.  
I've met good writers in my life though and most of them inspired me, yet I have no idea what I'm doing right now. I freeze on an open page, my english vocabulary is limited and I possess no formal writing education whatsover. What you are reading now might just be my first and humble attempt to improve.  

Is it for personal or professional reasons? I don't know yet, but if this exercise allows me to put words on paper in a slightly faster and better way I'd be happy.

Randomly but still fairly often, my mind goes down rabbit holes about various topics. From moral dilemmas to social or political initiatives including personal development exercises, I found myself having strong opinions based on even stronger values, I typed those in notes on my smartphone for the last 10 years at least. I guess having a summary of my thinking written down helps me subconsciously close the open loop. I can fully let go knowing it is there and it helps me question myself and define what I stand for.  

Let's take a baby step and try first to formalize those on here. I'm painfully aware that the internet doesn't need yet another random guy sharing his thoughts to the world but I decided to go ahead anyway, for myself.
