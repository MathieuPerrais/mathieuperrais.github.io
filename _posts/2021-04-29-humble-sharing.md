I've never been a writer, not even in my native language.  
I've met good writers in my life though and most of them inspired me, good writing is cool. 
Currently, I freeze on an open page, my english vocabulary is limited and I possess no formal writing education whatsover. 
We are in 2021 and this is my first and humble attempt to improve.  

Is it for personal or professional reasons? I don't know yet, but if this exercise allows me to put words on paper in a slightly faster and better way I'd be happy.
